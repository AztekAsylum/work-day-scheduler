# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

In this ticket. I worked on creating a simple calendar application that allows a usert to save events for hour of typcial working 9am-5pm day. It features the current day at the top of the calendar, time blocks fot the standard 9am to 5pm hours, color coded blocks to indicate whether its is in the past, present, or future, a user click to enter info into the time block, a save option for that block to store in local storage and when finished and you refresh the page the saved events remain.
